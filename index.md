## About Me

I work at the intersection of **computational optimal transport, numerical PDEs, and scientific machine learning**.

My research focuses on:
- Large-scale sparse linear algebra
- Solver acceleration and parameter optimization
- Finite element methods
- Primal-dual and splitting methods
- Optimal transport and Schrödinger bridge problems

## Current Research

### AI speed up for Large Sparse Matrix Computation
1. Developed a hybrid **Convolution Neural Network + MLP fusion model** for solver selection, achieving:

- 80.3% accuracy over 26 solver combinations  
- 3.83× speed-up in matrix solving  


2. Designed a graph-based Autoencoder-Decoder GNN initial value predictor for OpenFOAM pressure Poisson systems, achieving:
	•	1.67× average iteration speed-up
	•	13.16× maximum iteration speed-up
	•	1.79× average wall-time speed-up
	•	19.51× maximum wall-time speed-up


### Optimal Transport & Schrödinger Bridge
Implemented:

- Douglas–Rachford splitting
